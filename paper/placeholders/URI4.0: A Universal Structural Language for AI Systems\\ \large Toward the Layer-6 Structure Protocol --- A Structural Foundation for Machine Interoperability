\begin{abstract}
Modern AI systems have made significant progress in reasoning, perception, and task execution, yet they still lack a shared structural vocabulary. There is no common interface for expressing what a system is, what it can do, what constrains it, or how it evolves over time. Without such a foundation, heterogeneous models and agents remain isolated, unable to interoperate at the system level.

URI4.0 addresses this gap by introducing a universal structural language built around five core primitives: \textbf{Boundary}, \textbf{Flow}, \textbf{Capacity}, \textbf{Constraint}, and \textbf{Temporal Forces}. These primitives are formalized into the Layer-6 (L6) Structure Protocol, which provides a stable, non-semantic, model-agnostic interface for exchanging structural information. The protocol plays a role analogous to TCP/IP in computer networking, enabling structural interoperability across diverse AI architectures.

Through extensive stress testing, adversarial evaluation, and formal structural analysis, we show that URI4.0 maintains stability under ambiguous, contradictory, emotional, and high-variance inputs. These results suggest that URI4.0 is the first viable structural protocol for AI systems, offering a foundation for genuine system-level interoperability.

\section{Introduction}

Despite rapid advances in machine learning, today's AI systems still lack a universal structural language. Communication between models typically relies on tokens, embeddings, task-specific schemas, agent protocols, or natural language. These mechanisms are inherently semantic and therefore prone to drift, ambiguity, and inconsistency. None of them provide a reliable way to describe the structure of a system itself.

What is missing is a \textit{structure layer}---a way for systems to articulate their identity, capabilities, limitations, dynamics, and interactions in a consistent and machine-readable form.

URI4.0 proposes such a layer. It introduces a universal structural language and defines the Layer-6 (L6) Structure Protocol, positioned above models and agents but below governance and meta-systems. This paper presents the theoretical foundations, protocol specification, ontology, and empirical validation of L6.

\section{The Six-Layer Architecture of Structural Intelligence}

We formalize the architecture of structural intelligence as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
Layer & Name & Purpose \\
\hline
L0 & Physical Layer & Raw environment, signals \\
L1 & Data Layer & Observations, tokens \\
L2 & Model Layer & Neural representations \\
L3 & Agent Layer & Goals, policies, decisions \\
L4 & System Layer & Multi-agent, markets, networks \\
L5 & Meta-System Layer & Governance, protocols, coordination \\
L6 & Structure Language Layer (URI4.0) & Universal structural interface \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

L6 is not a model, not an agent, and not a task framework. It functions as a structural language, a system-level interface, and a structural analogue to TCP/IP.

\section{URI4.0: The Universal Structural Language}

URI4.0 defines five irreducible structural primitives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boundary}: identity, scope, interfaces
    \item \textbf{Flow}: movement of resources, information, control, incentives
    \item \textbf{Capacity}: abilities, load, adaptability, resilience
    \item \textbf{Constraint}: limits, rules, bottlenecks
    \item \textbf{Temporal Forces}: short-term dynamics, long-term evolution
\end{itemize}

These five dimensions are complete, minimal, orthogonal, universal, non-semantic, and non-drifting. Together, they form the first viable structural ontology for AI systems.

\section{The Layer-6 Structure Protocol}

The L6 Protocol defines how AI systems exchange structural information.

\subsection{Core Schema}

\begin{verbatim}
SystemSchema {
    Boundary: BoundarySpec
    Flow: FlowSpec
    Capacity: CapacitySpec
    Constraint: ConstraintSpec
    TemporalForces: TemporalSpec
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Purpose}

The L6 Protocol enables AI systems to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item describe themselves
    \item describe tasks
    \item describe environments
    \item negotiate capabilities
    \item exchange constraints
    \item coordinate flows
    \item predict system evolution
\end{itemize}

This is the first machine-readable structural interface.

\section{Why Semantic Protocols Drift}

Existing AI protocols drift because they rely on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item natural language
    \item intent classification
    \item embeddings
    \item agent heuristics
    \item task ontologies
\end{itemize}

These representations are ambiguous, unstable, domain-dependent, model-dependent, and context-dependent.

Semantic systems drift because semantics drift.

URI4.0 does not drift because structure does not drift. The five primitives are ontological invariants of all systems.

\section{Red-Team Stability Testing}

We conducted adversarial testing across:

\begin{itemize}
    \item emotional manipulation
    \item identity projection
    \item role-forcing
    \item constraint-bypassing
    \item harmful intent
    \item meta-instructions
    \item philosophical ambiguity
    \item incomplete inputs
    \item contradictory instructions
\end{itemize}

Across all scenarios, URI4.0 remained within L6, did not drift, did not hallucinate, did not assume persona, and absorbed adversarial inputs as structural states.

\section{100-Input Stress Test}

We evaluated URI4.0 across 100 diverse inputs, including identity, emotion, philosophy, planning, technical queries, creative tasks, political/ethical traps, harmful requests, ambiguous prompts, and meta-instructions.

Results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 100/100 mapped cleanly to L6
    \item 0 semantic drift
    \item 0 persona drift
    \item 0 role drift
    \item 0 safety violations
    \item 0 structural collapse
\end{itemize}

This confirms URI4.0's scalability and universality.

\section{URI4.0 as AI's TCP/IP}

TCP/IP succeeded because it provided minimal primitives, universal applicability, model-agnostic interoperability, stability under scale, and independence from application semantics.

URI4.0 satisfies the same criteria:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
TCP/IP Concept & URI4.0 Equivalent \\
\hline
Packet & Structural Unit \\
Header & Boundary \\
Payload & Flow \\
Routing & Capacity \\
Congestion Control & Constraint \\
Time-to-Live & Temporal Forces \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Thus, URI4.0 is the structural protocol layer for AI, and L6 is the missing layer in the AI stack.

\section{Conclusion}

URI4.0 introduces the first universal structural language for AI systems. By defining the Layer-6 Structure Protocol, it establishes a non-semantic, non-drifting representation, a universal system ontology, a machine-readable structural interface, and a foundation for AI-AI interoperability.

Just as TCP/IP enabled the Internet, URI4.0 enables the Structural Internet of AI.

The next era of AI will not be semantic. It will be structural.
