# URI4.0: A Multi-Dimensional Structural Analysis Schema for Complex Systems

URI4.0 is a domain-agnostic, multi-dimensional structural analysis schema designed to
evaluate complex systems through five analytical dimensions:

1. Collaboration Structure Features  
2. Process Performance Patterns  
3. Potential Resource Expressions  
4. Regulatory Adaptation Patterns  
5. Developmental Trend Drivers  

This repository serves as the official home for the URI4.0 framework, including the
conceptual foundation, structural definitions, case studies, and supporting materials.

## Overview

Modern systems—organizational, technical, ecological, or global—often behave in ways
that extend beyond their formal descriptions. URI4.0 provides a unified structural
perspective for understanding:

- Structural residuals  
- Flow deviations  
- Latent resource activation  
- Constraint flexibility  
- Long-term trend dynamics  

The framework is fully de-AI-ified, de-sensitized, and suitable for academic,
theoretical, and applied system analysis.
