# URI4.0: A Multi-Dimensional Structural Analysis Schema for Complex Systems

URI4.0 is a domain-agnostic, multi-dimensional structural analysis schema designed to
evaluate complex systems through five analytical dimensions:

1. Collaboration Structure Features  
2. Process Performance Patterns  
3. Potential Resource Expressions  
4. Regulatory Adaptation Patterns  
5. Developmental Trend Drivers  

This repository serves as the official home for the URI4.0 framework, including the
conceptual foundation, structural definitions, case studies, and supporting materials.

## Overview

Modern systems—organizational, technical, ecological, or global—often behave in ways
that extend beyond their formal descriptions. URI4.0 provides a unified structural
perspective for understanding:

- Structural residuals  
- Flow deviations  
- Latent resource activation  
- Constraint flexibility  
- Long-term trend dynamics

## Copyright

See the COPYRIGHT section below for full details.

## Status

This repository is published to establish authorship, provide an official timestamp,
and preserve the provenance of the URI4.0 framework. Additional materials will be
added as the framework evolves.
The framework is fully de-AI-ified, de-sensitized, and suitable for academic,
theoretical, and applied system analysis.

## Licensing Recommendation
To support open adoption while preserving the integrity of the protocol, we recommend releasing URI4.0 and the L6 Structure Protocol under either CC BY‑ND or Apache 2.0, depending on the intended ecosystem direction.

CC BY‑ND (Attribution–NoDerivatives)  
Best suited if the goal is to maintain a stable, authoritative definition of the protocol and prevent uncontrolled modifications to the core L6 primitives or schema.

Apache 2.0 License  
Preferable if broad industry integration is desired, especially for AI vendors, toolchain developers, and system architects who may need to embed or extend the protocol within larger software systems.

Both licenses support open distribution, but they differ in how they balance protocol stability and ecosystem flexibility.
